‚ú® Project Overview  

This project is a fully open-source mechanical watch design. It includes all necessary CAD design files (such as STEP and STL), a bill of materials (BOM), and detailed assembly instructions. Our goal is to allow watch enthusiasts, engineers, and students to experience the charm of mechanical watchmaking at a low cost, while encouraging learning, modification, and innovation based on this project.  

Design Philosophy: This is an automatic mechanical watch that combines a minimalist exterior with a complex mechanical movement‚Äîa collision of Bauhaus and Corbusier styles.  

Target Audience:  
- Mechanical watch enthusiasts  
- 3D printing and DIY hobbyists  
- Industrial design students and educators  
- Open-source hardware community

‚öôÔ∏è Features  

- **3D-Printed Main Body**: The case and crown can be 3D printed using resin or metal, significantly reducing cost and barriers to entry.  
- **Universal Movement**: Designed around widely available generic mechanical watch movements (Hangzhou movement) for easy sourcing.  
- **Modular Design**: Components such as lugs, dials, and hands can be easily replaced and customized.

üì¶ Required Materials & Tools  

**Bill of Materials (BOM)**  
For details, refer to the [`Docs/BOM.xlsx`](Docs/BOM.xlsx) file. Core components include:  
1. **Movement**: Hangzhou 1C02D √ó 1  
2. **Hands**: A set of hands compatible with the 1C02D movement (universal ETA 2824 movement hands)  
3. **Crystal**: Sapphire or mineral glass crystal (23.2 √ó 30.2 √ó 1.5 mm)  
4. **Strap**: Universal 22mm leather/metal strap √ó 1  
5. **3D Printing Materials**: High-precision resin (for gears) / nylon or metal (for the case)  
6. **Fasteners**: M1.6 √ó 3mm screws √ó 8  
7. **Other**: UV adhesive, screw-locking glue  

**Essential Tools**  
- Precision screwdriver set  
- Flush cutters  
- Tweezers  
- Needle  
- Blunt-tip glue syringe

üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Guide  

For the complete illustrated and video assembly guide, refer to [`Docs/Assembly_Guide.pdf`](Docs/Assembly_Guide.pdf). Below is a brief overview:  

1. **Prepare Parts**: Print all 3D components, remove supports, and sand them. Clean all purchased parts.  
2. **Install the Crystal**: Apply the scale sticker to the crystal, place the crystal into the case (ensure the scale faces inward), evenly apply UV adhesive around the crystal using a syringe, and cure it with a UV light. Repeat the process for the case back crystal.  
3. **Assemble the Dial**: For the luminescent version, apply luminous paint to the scale grooves, let it dry completely, and then place it into the case.  
4. **Assemble the Water-Resistant Tube**: Apply screw-locking glue to the tube, insert it into the designated position on the case, and let it sit for 24 hours.  
5. **Install the Hands**: Use a hand-setting tool to install the hour, minute, and second hands in sequence. (**Note**: This step requires patience!)  
6. **Install the Movement into the Case**: Remove the movement stem, then carefully place the assembled "movement-hands" unit into the case.  
7. **Install the Stem**: Insert the stem into the movement.  
8. **Secure the Case Back**: Place the case back and tighten the screws.  
9. **Attach the Strap**: Insert the spring bars through the lugs.  
10. **Testing and Winding**: Wind the watch, check if it keeps time accurately, and ensure the hands do not rub against each other or the crystal.

üé® Customization & Modification  

The charm of this project lies in the freedom to modify it!  
- **Case Design**: Use Creo/Rhino software to modify the shape, dimensions, and textures of the case.  
- **Dial Design**: We provide an Adobe Illustrator template (`Dial.ai`) for designing your own dial.  
- **Mixed Materials**: Experiment with different materials for printing parts, such as using stainless steel for the case or transparent resin for a "skeleton" dial.
